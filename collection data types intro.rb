# arrays = ordered lists like grocery list 

# hashes (ruby specific) = like a a lookup table or dictionary

#collection data type holds multiple pieces of data and allows us to talk about the collection as an abstraction. can't be put on a scale

#individual pieces of data inside an array are called elements.

#Hashes use key instead of index. Like JS Object
