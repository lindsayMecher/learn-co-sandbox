1) Identify the problem 2) Identify the output that would solve the problem 3) Name the procedure that fixes the problem 4) Identify what inputs are needed to create the output 5) Define the procedureâ€™s implementation 6) Translate the procedure description into code 7) Verify the procedure's output

When it comes to code, it's important to remember that you don't only want to implement your solution, you want to optimize your implementation.

Testing and revision is a natural part of the programming process. Now we have a sub-process to loop through:

Adjust input
Adjust implementation
Spin-off sub-procedures
Verify output (if necessary)
Move from success to success, accumulating success
